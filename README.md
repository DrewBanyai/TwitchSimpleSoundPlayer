# SimpleTwitchBotJS
A dead-simple skeleton project to play local sound files when chat commands trigger them in Twitch

To use:
- Drop this folder onto your desktop or another local folder on your computer
- Drop any number of MP3 sound files into the Sounds folder, ensuring they have no spaces in the filenames
- Open the index.htm file in a browser by double-clicking it
- Log in by setting the channel to listen to, and a valid OAuth (which can be acquired by clicking the ? symbol on the login screen)
- In the chat of the selected channel, use the sound command  ('!' plus the file name, minus '.mp3') ... i.e. to play bruh.mp3, use '!bruh'
